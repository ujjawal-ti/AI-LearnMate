Troubleshooting ToolX

Command not found

Make sure ToolX is added to your PATH.

Try running: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/toolx/bin

Dependency errors

Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Check Python version (must be 3.9 or above).

Configuration file not detected

Ensure .toolx exists in your home directory.

Re-run: toolx init

Scripts fail to execute

Verify script path is correct.

Use absolute paths if relative ones fail.

Logs are missing

Confirm that the logs/ folder exists.

ToolX writes logs to logs/ by default.

If issues persist, run:
toolx diagnose
and share the output with the support team.
